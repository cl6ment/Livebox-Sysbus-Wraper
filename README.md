# livebox

This simple python script is a wraper around the sysbus api of sagem Livebox. It allows you to view WIFI state & change it.

## How to use it?

You need to have python 3 installed on your machine.
Make sure to have all the following packages installed:
* requests
* json
* os

## What's left to do ?

This script was a first try sniffing api & requests using wireshark. It now needs to be rewritten using class. I will eventually add more functionnalities to this project as time goes on.
